# Jolt

Fall Semester of Sophomore year I was a part of a student organization called Generate which is Northeasterns student-led build studio. Generate works with clients to further their ideas. We provide a semesters worth of free engineering. My time in Generate has been primarily working as a build studio engineer meaning I help bring the client's idea to life. 

Jolt is one of the projects I worked on during my sophomore fall semester. Jolt is a wearable electronic alarm that shocks users awake. Throughout this project I helped build and design the PCB and schematic. I also worked in a team of engineers whom varried in mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering. All of the files I created and worked on can be found in this repository. 

What I learned while working on this project:
  - Interfacing with real time clocks
  - Charging circuits for LiPo batteries
  - PCB conventions
  - Schematic conventions
  - Reading datasheets
  - Picking parts
  - Team communication and effectiveness
